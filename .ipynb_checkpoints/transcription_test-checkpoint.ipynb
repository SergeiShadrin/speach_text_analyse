And d on the level of the armatures, y it's a system of armature pre-constraint which has been made by society Effage, a subsidiary of Eiffage, and we had to test that in an Institute Carnot , the the CRIB which had to put in place a a constraint price constraint it is state on average one, we had a putt that was ten metre long, and we had to break it with our our system or the the ecosystem that is available for us to use.

      "Donc on renvoie la balle. On dit qu'on n'est pas prêt pour cette technologie, il faut investir en R&D. Ce n'est pas moi qui investis dans la R&D. En revanche, j'ai essayé de le faire sur certains sujets. Je vais vous parler de mauvaises expériences et de bonnes expériences. Alors, mauvaise expérience, ça a été sur un sujet, donc sur des matériaux à changement de phase. Donc j'ai rencontré des matériaux à changement de phase. Ils permettent de capter de la chaleur et en relarguer en fonction des températures ou s'il y a de l'ensoleillement ou pas. Et donc de réduire au niveau de l'enveloppe du bâtiment l'aspect thermique et vous dites bien ce qui peut se passer après pour le bâtiment. Il y a moins de chauffage, moins d'énergie, moins de carbone, moins d'impact. Alors j'ai rencontré cette université qui avait développé un matériau à changement de phase très intéressant. J'étais très motivé. Et on a commencé à échanger. En échange, ils m'ont demandé quel va être votre volume dans les cinq prochaines années ? Quels vont être les chiffres d'affaires que vous allez générer ? Quelle va être la marge que vous allez générer ? Et nous, on va prendre 50%. Alors j'étais scié, sidéré. Et donc j'ai dit déjà le marché, je vais le travailler, mais je ne vais pas vous le donner. Et la marge, je ne connais pas encore l'acceptation sur le marché. Ça se nécessite de le travailler aussi. Et donc on a été bloqués très rapidement. On n'a pas pu faire affaire ensemble, malheureusement. Une expérience plus positive. On travaille bien sûr sur de l'impression 3D, l'impression 3D béton. On se pose la question qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire avec cette technologie, qui est une technologie puche, qui est une invention. Et là, on essaye de trouver un marché potentiel. Alors bien sûr, on voit tout et n'importe quoi sur YouTube et tous les réseaux sociaux avec des applications dans le bâtiment, avec des ouvrages plus ou moins modernes, inventifs. Mais l'acceptation actuelle par le marché, elle n'est pas encore arrivée. En revanche, on a mis au point une technologie avec un partenariat industriel, avec plusieurs acteurs, parce qu'on n'avait pas le savoir-faire. Et donc comme d'autres, on va chercher le savoir-faire là où il est. Donc on est allé chercher un architecte designer à l'université de Pennsylvania, aux Etats-Unis, qui a développé un système de conception qui permet de réduire jusqu'à 60% la quantité de matière. Et donc au niveau des armatures, c'est un système d'armature pré-contrainte qui a été mis en œuvre par la société Eiffage, sa filiale Aevia. Et on est allé tester ça dans un institut Carnot, le CERIM, qui a pu mettre en œuvre une poutre pré-contrainte et tester à l'échelle 1 quasiment. Donc on avait une poutre qui faisait 10 mètres de long et on a pu la casser avec l'écosystème qu'ils avaient mis en œuvre pour nous accompagner. C'était une très bonne réussite. Et donc grâce à ça, on a répondu à un appel à projet CERIMA pour réaliser une vraie passerelle dans la vraie vie et on espère pouvoir démontrer la suite. Merci, je pense que vous parliez du Carnot MECD avec le CERIM. Thibaut, la question que je vais vous poser est un petit peu piège parce que finalement vous avez eu plusieurs casquettes. Pour vous Thibaut, quels sont les points forts des partenariats avec la recherche publique et à l'inverse, les principaux obstacles que vous avez rencontrés en tant qu'entrepreneur pour créer une véritable synergie ? En fait, c'est quand on crée une startup Deep Tech qui vient du monde de la santé, on est confronté à pas mal de freins. Le premier, c'est licencier ses propres brevets. Donc pour le coup, faire des discussions de licence avec CNRS Innovation et SEM Transfer, c'est pas simple mais on y arrive. Ça prend deux ans. En même temps, il est important de sécuriser les fonds quand on veut faire une levée de fonds. Tant qu'on n'a pas les fonds, on n'a pas les brevets, tant qu'on n'a pas les brevets, on n'a pas les fonds. Donc c'est un peu le serpent qui se meurt la queue mais ils ont relativement l'habitude de le faire. Et une fois qu'on a sécurisé ses brevets, il faut les mettre en oeuvre. Et un des sujets clés de mon expérience chez Netree, c'est de transformer une invention en un produit. En un produit et trouver le bon market fit. Surtout sur l'innovation Deep Tech. En introduction, je vous ai montré l'intérêt général. Tout le monde y conçoit mais il faut que les industriels pharmaceutiques, les institutionnels qui régulent et le marché trouvent l'intérêt immédiat. Et souvent il y a un serpent qui se meurt la queue entre revenir quand c'est prêt et on est prêt pour les industriels qui accepteraient ce genre de technologie. Mais il faut montrer suffisamment de preuves que la technologie marche pour répondre à leurs questions. Donc c'est un peu un cercle qui se construit d'investissement de la part du Deep Tech qui en même temps ne gagne rien. Donc là c'est un sujet d'investissement fondamental. En ce moment, dans les biotech, ça ne va pas très très bien. Donc c'est pour ça que Netree a décidé d'aller à la rentabilité rapidement et toujours investir, donc se concentrer, se focaliser sur des applications dont le marché est présent. Et c'est là où c'est un peu compliqué quand on a la double casquette entrepreneur-chercheur, c'est qu'on a envie de tout faire. Et on est très rapidement ramené à l'arrêté de « non, non, concentre-toi sur une application, monte ton modèle économique et réplique ça sur d'autres cas d'indications ». Et ça c'est un des premiers points de se focaliser et de ne pas se disperser. Quand on fait de la recherche partenariale, parfois on a tendance à un peu se laisser aller sur « on fait de la création ». C'est-à-dire en député créatif. Le deuxième point c'était, nous on est passé au bout de 4 ans, donc on a fait nos produits, j'en ai ramené je pourrais vous montrer tout à l'heure. C'est de trouver les bonnes personnes et passer à la phase de scale-up. Alors là on passe à une autre phase, ça change la typologie, au démarrage vous êtes une dizaine, quinzaine maximum, c'est sympa. Mais quand ça devient du business, ça devient un enjeu de survie parce que les investisseurs ne sont plus là pour vous suivre, là il faut faire des produits, des réels, des vrais produits, il faut les produire. Et souvent comme ce sont des technologies de rupture qu'on a mis en place, on ne peut pas aller outsourcer ces technologies comme vous l'avez pu le faire. Donc on a été obligé de créer nous-mêmes nos technologies pour fabriquer les nouvelles technologies. Ce qui crée une deuxième phase d'enjeu puisque à Lyon nous avons créé cette usine de production, 1500m² de production, 15 millions d'euros d'investis, sur des chaînes technologiques qu'on ne savait même pas si ça allait marcher. Et c'est là par exemple qu'on est allé voir le CEA, à Grenoble, que je connais bien, qui beaucoup nous a aidé à réfléchir à comment optimiser cette usine de production. Mais pas que le CEA, on est aussi allé voir des entreprises privées comme MGA Technologies dans la région lyonnaise qui eux avaient un savoir-faire d'upscale. Donc c'est en fait l'accumulation de plusieurs partenaires clés qui vont donner lieu à de l'innovation nocturne à chaque phase de développement d'entreprise. Quand on a préparé Thibault, j'ai noté un démo où vous avez évoqué peut-être parfois la méconnaissance de la réalité industrielle des chercheurs. Est-ce que vous pouvez étayer un petit peu ? Je ne vais pas hésiter, d'autant plus que moi-même ancien chercheur, je vais pouvoir dire certaines choses sans langue de bois. Dans la maîtrise copilote de la filière française des organo-desorganes-sur-puce, qui fait partie du contrat stratégique du filaire, et à ce titre-là, on fédère avec les acteurs académiques, donc CNRS, INSEAM, CEA, l'ensemble de cette filière. Et ce que je constate, c'est que souvent le chercheur va avoir l'intuition que sa découverte est extraordinaire, et elle est souvent le cas. Mais parfois elle n'est pas en adéquation avec la réalité produite du marché. Et donc c'est là où je dis qu'il y a un continuum à avoir entre la recherche fondamentale qui est extrêmement nécessaire et indispensable, et la recherche industrielle, c'est-à-dire écouter les besoins des industriels pour les traduire en produits. Alors je vous le dis, moi le premier produit quand j'étais au CNRS, c'était des petites puces de Rendit-You, et aujourd'hui on a créé des produits qui sont sur des standards industriels, qui sont acceptés par l'industrie pharmaceutique. Et donc souvent, là où c'est un peu compliqué de faire entendre aux chercheurs que son ovation est très bien, mais que la transformation à l'étape industrielle peut être lourde, complexe, parfois impossible, et souvent là il y a des moments de friction. Comme je vous disais tout à l'heure, l'accès aux cellules souches, où il y a des magnifiques cellules qui sont faites dans les laboratoires à l'échelle du prototype, mais quand il faut passer à l'échelle industrielle, où il y a vraiment du quality control à faire, et de manière répéditée et reproductible, là il y a un effort, et souvent c'est pas très bien compris, donc des tensions de friction. La plupart du temps ça se passe bien. Merci, alors le ministre est parti, du coup on va vous donner la main sur les orientations de la recherche publique et les dispositifs de soutien à la recherche partenariale. Messieurs, vous êtes ministre, quelles seraient vos priorités ? Si vous aviez le pouvoir de décider, allez Fabrice, Cyril plutôt, excusez-moi je vous laisse démarrer. Moi je pense trois messages. Le premier sur les dispositifs d'aide. Je pense que le premier message c'est vraiment arriver à concentrer les aides. Quand je vois le nombre de personnes qui viennent me voir en me disant on est prêt à vous aider, on peut vous aider pour faire un diagnostic cyber, pour faire un bilan carbone, pour faire un truc. Des fois j'ai l'impression qu'il y a plus de monde qui est là pour m'aider que de personnes qui sont à l'intérieur pour bosser. Chez Aiva le bureau d'études c'est un peu plus de 20 personnes, c'est pas gigantesque. Donc arriver à concentrer les aides et faire vraiment utiliser les dispositifs qui marchent. On parlait tout à l'heure de choses qui marchent, vraiment capitaliser dessus et continuer. Moi je réinsiste sur un dispositif que je trouve particulièrement efficace, c'est le fonctionnement du CORAC, donc le comité pour la recherche aéronautique civile avec le dispositif CORAC PME. Pourquoi ? Parce qu'il nous force à dialoguer avec nos clients et un des éléments fondamentaux avant d'avoir du financement c'est avoir la garantie par les clients que le marché est là et que le besoin existe. Ils nous permettent de rentrer en contact avec l'ensemble des acteurs et à bâtir de la recherche partenariale avec les bons acteurs sur les bons domaines. Et puis c'est des montants qui sont significatifs. Pour Aiva je parlais de 3 à 4 millions d'euros avec une subvention à 50%. C'est vraiment un élément déclencheur et sans ce dispositif on l'aurait pas fait. Donc capitaliser sur ce qui marche et surtout se focaliser sur les dispositifs efficaces avec du retour d'expérience et éviter d'avoir du sous-poudrage et des choses un petit peu partout. Le deuxième message c'est aussi ne pas négliger les phases d'industrialisation et les process de production qui sont fondamentaux. En fait j'ai l'impression qu'on se concentre beaucoup sur la R&D très amont pour faire des prototypes, des choses très innovantes mais quelque part il y a une courbe en S. Le gros des dépenses et ce qu'il faut arriver à franchir c'est la phase d'industrie qui nécessite beaucoup de financement avec des process qu'il faut maîtriser parce que derrière on parle de fiabilité, de répétabilité, de tout un tas de choses. Et je pense qu'il faut vraiment aussi ne pas oublier cette industrie et ses process quand on parle de financement de la R&D. Et le troisième message qui va peut-être s'éloigner, je n'ai pas du tout l'objectif de faire de la politique mais c'est que j'ai vécu plusieurs choses en fait. Aeva a été propriétaire d'un groupe anglo-saxon qui n'a pas fait d'investissement pendant quasiment dix ans et est maintenant propriétaire de la famille Perrier donc d'une ETI familiale avec une personne, François Perrier, qui s'est vraiment investi dans une mission de réindustrialiser la France et qui injecte au global sur le pôle aérodéfense on a investi un peu plus de 10 millions en trois ans. Et c'est un choix personnel en fait, ils ont plus de 50% dans l'économie.\n",
      "\n",
      "dans l'entreprise et je pense qu'en France on a pour faire de l'ARD il faut des financements, il faut des personnes qui investissent à titre personnel et je pense qu'on en a quand on a la chance comme ça d'avoir une ETI familiale avec des personnes qui sont investies qui sont prêts à mettre des données personnelles dans les dans l'aventure c'est extrêmement important il faut surtout les encourager et pas les faire fuir voilà. Merci Cyril, Fabrice même question vous êtes ministre. Merci pour cette proposition bon c'est très compliqué comme question déjà je prendrai jamais le poste c'est trop difficile alors en revanche donc je suis très content qu'il y en ait qui le fassent. Moi mon avis simple c'est que je trouve que la partie recherche est beaucoup trop monétisée c'est on se marche sur les pieds entre la recherche privée et la recherche publique on est en compétition et on dépose des brevets pour se protéger j'aimerais si c'était le cas qu'on puisse trouver des axes stratégiques majeurs qui pour moi sont liés au dérèglement climatique et la captation du co2 je vais vous donner un exemple il ya en gros 2000 entreprises en france dans le bâtiment qui passent leur temps au niveau R&D à essayer de trouver des solutions bas carbone et on pourrait essayer de tous se mutualiser et mettre au minimum 50% de l'argent qui est dépensé par tous pour ça même au niveau R&D pour essayer de trouver une solution pour séquestrer ce carbone qui est émis au niveau des cimenteries ça génère entre 6 et 8% de gaz à effet de serre au niveau de la planète et donc c'est un enjeu très important et pour le bien de tous c'est encore des industries lourdes qui nous restent en france et qui permettraient de sécuriser l'enjeu voilà c'est un exemple je pense qu'il pourrait y en avoir d'autres sur la biodiversité sur le recyclage le recyclage des matériaux et c'est un vrai enjeu on génère énormément de déchets vous pouvez regarder les poubelles que vous avez que vous remplissez vous mettez tous les matins sur le bord de la route la quantité de déchets qu'on génère qu'on n'arrive pas à utiliser est énorme donc on pourra avoir des actions pour simplifier le réemploi dans les matériaux déjà existants ou et de créer ces filières ensemble puisque je reprends la proposition de Cyril qui expliquait en fait que la R&D c'est une partie de la problématique et si on regarde jusque la fin d'un produit l'industrialisation et la commercialisation la R&D représente 5% en moyenne donc c'est tout petit par rapport à tous les investissements qui sont nécessaires et souvent alors qu'on a de la R&D fantastique je pense qu'on a tous les scientifiques tous les laboratoires on a tout ce qu'il faut il faut qu'on mette un peu plus d'humains dans la boucle et de bien choisir des sujets qu'on pense que les enfants qui naissent aujourd'hui à 2100 ils ont 70 ans et ils vont vivre minimum plus 4 degrés voilà donc comment on fait pour pour travailler tous ensemble pour limiter ça ou se prévenir de ce risque quand on avait préparé vous m'aviez évoqué aussi le manque d'éléments pour éclairer la direction des transitions alors donc sur cette partie sciences humaines je pense qu'on est très axé technologie et on devrait aussi un maître dans la boucle la partie science molle comme on dit pour mieux nous orienter mieux de vous diriger vers ce qui est réellement attendu et par les gens de quoi on a besoin pour vivre et qu'on sache qu'on nous fournisse ces informations thibault qu'est ce que vous pensez de ce qui a été dit et quels seraient vos priorités sans être ministre mais moi ce que je constate c'est un peu de manque de pragmatisme et un peu moins de réalité aujourd'hui quand vous êtes un industriel pharmaceutique ou soi-disant vous avez plein d'argent vous allez voir les chercheurs français vous êtes perdu chacun oeuvre un peu pour lui parce que c'est très orienté c'est très perso quand même et donc du coup il ya un foisonnement de technologies accessibles et on s'est compliqués je pense que le problème va pas d'hier mais moi si j'étais ministre en tout cas je mettrais des priorités et je n'hésiterai pas à nommer des champions ce que je reproche un peu je l'ai vu dans les politiques globales c'est on saupoudre alors que dans d'autres pays ils n'hésitent pas à prendre des paris alors qu'ils sont qui sont bien choisis réfléchis pas de mandatoires et de pas de cognitif de copinisme mais évidemment créer des champions des hôtels dont cette personne est en charge de cette thématique et non du coup quand on veut aller discuter on va discuter avec cette personne là et ça je pense que c'est un peu le principe de réalité et nous quand on est jeune industriel d'aller faire tour de tous les labos de france et c'est long et c'est pas ce dont on souhaite donc ça c'est une première chose la deuxième chose c'est que la recherche partenaire il me semble que l'idée c'est de faire un plus un égal trois et le problème n'est pas dans les deux un il est dans plus et là il ya un sujet fondamental de comment est ce qu'on fonctionne et c'est très vrai en france propos d'avoir vécu aux états unis c'est assez simple de créer des consortiums ce qui est magnifique ce qu'on a la bpi on a cet instrument qui est génial on peut on peut forcer des consortiums et l'écrit from scratch quand on a une bonne idée c'est pas si simple et moi je trouve que le plus devrait porter par certains membres du pouvoir public on parlait tout à l'heure de la difficulté de créer des tout de suite on parle d'un en fait il faut je pense arrêter de dire que grâce aux partenariats publics privés qui sont essentiels la recherche publique va pouvoir se financer en partie c'est comme vous l'avez dit c'est plus tard c'est bien après et au contraire il faudrait libérer complètement les capacités de de travailler ensemble et après parler des considérations économiques une fois qu'on montrait qu'il ya vraiment marché ça je pense que ça libérerait beaucoup beaucoup de partenariats publics privés et de faire des consortiums qui soit le plus vraiment dans le plus comme je disais tout à l'heure merci alors si on résume il ya trois trois grandes idées la mutualisation la championnisation on évite le sepoudrage on s'était dit lorsqu'on a préparé que ça serait bien qu'on a un petit peu de temps pour prendre des questions dans la salle pour réagir par rapport à ces propositions de nos trois futurs ministres donc on a le temps de prendre une ou deux questions je vous demanderai de lever la main si vous avez une question de dire qui vous êtes et puis de poser la question à un de nos trois témoins qui veut se lancer je vais jusqu'à vous je suis pas sûr bonjour moi même je suis je travaille dans la santé dans la recherche plutôt chirurgien et en travailler beaucoup aussi au royaume uni donc je connais très très bien ces problèmes et le partenariat public privé que je vois qui existe partout c'est surtout changer la mentalité je pense qui est très important plutôt que de dire que ce sont les politiques publiques où on tape un peu trop dessus à mon niveau à mon avis ce que je voulais vous poser une question à vous trois et ça m'a monsieur vous travaillez ainsi car pour le béton vous avez fait appel à un ingénieur qui venait je crois de pennsylvanie c'est ce que j'ai cru comprendre il y a des pépites d'or en france il ya beaucoup d'entreprises designers et j'ai cru comprendre par rapport à tout ce que vous avez dit les compétences il faut aller les chercher et très souvent vous travaillez en silo donc vous ne savez pas où trouver les compétences elles existent et elles sont brillantes brillantissime et monsieur pour les cellules souches puisque ça m'intéresse c'est quand même un domaine que je connais très très bien et vous avez dit que vous avez acheté des cellules à étrangers c'est qui est très paradoxal et qui touche un domaine très particulier puisque les cellules il faut vraiment éviter le procès c'est très important pourtant encore une fois ça existe et moi j'ai l'impression que à travers tout ce que vous avez dit il ya beaucoup d'entreprises qui sont très mal informés je pense qu'il ya plusieurs couches administratifs on sait pas où trouver toutes les réponses le problème de skylab dont vous faites vous avez dit il est très mal diffusé aux gens vous êtes très présent dans les salons et dans les mêmes salons on voit pas beaucoup d'académiciens et de personnes compétentes qui n'assiste pas à ces salons le dernier en date était il ya et santé je peux vous dire que la plupart des gens qui sont experts ils étaient experts dans la tech dans les entreprises mais pas les compétences où vous pourriez les trouver donc à mon avis l'horizontalisation n'existe pas et je pense ce qui manque en france un petit rappel tout bête vous allez à l'université de cambridge university au royaume uni vous avez le bâtiment d'astraxeneca qui a accolé vous allez à séoul vous avez les hôpitaux financés par samsung donc il n'y a aucun problème le reset qu'il faut faire en france et que pendant longtemps on pense que les big pharma c'est mal un c'est il ya le compotisme et le narratif médiatif qui ne n'aide pas et moi j'espère que vraiment il faut qu'on parle ensemble qu'on soit présent mais les compétences existent il y a des financements que la plupart des petites et et pme ne connaissent pas très très bien parce qu'un manque de diffusion merci pour votre question est ce que quelqu'un veut répondre il ya eu plusieurs plusieurs éléments thibault oui je vais répondre rapidement alors vous avez raison madame sur plein de points et sur le la stigmatisation des grandes industriels pharmaceutiques c'est clair on a aussi des champions en france et paquet dans le domaine de la santé globalement dans l'opinion publique peut avoir parfois des mauvaises des mauvaises images pour des histoires relayées par les médias indépendant de ça sur il ya effectivement des accès en tant que jeune entreprise en accompagné par la french tech par tout un des pays donc on connaît évidemment tous les mécanismes de financement tel point de maîtrise aujourd'hui je peux même plus postuler les pays tellement les subventionnés donc donc ça on connaît bien en revanche sur l'accès aux cellules souches sachez que c'est un problème réglementaire donc aujourd'hui la rgpd nous empêche d'avoir de fabriquer des biobanques en europe les choses sont en train d'évoluer pour des applications vitro évidemment pas pour de tout ou aussi toutes les applications hétérogènes mais c'est en train d'évoluer on y travaille au sein d'un filière avec des sénateurs au niveau européen pour qu'on puisse avoir des cellules souches françaises et en partenariat avec le fs avec l'inserm avec le cdrs qui nous donne les techniques technologies pour le faire et nous à nous de les industrialiser par la suite merci thibault alors je suis rappelé à l'ordre sur le temps qui file je vais remercier nos trois témoins industriels pour leur clarté leur sincérité et puis la réalité qu'ils ont accepté de partager avec nous c'est l'heure de la pause merci à vous alors juste attendez les consignes il est exactement 11h21 à 11h32 tout le monde est revenu dans la salle\n",
